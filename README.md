## Project Scope

This project was developed for the Operating Systems Discipline of University of Madeira, Computer Engineering Course.

The main goal of this project was to implement a multithreaded solution that simulated the operation of three hospital units for the screening of the COVID-19 virus.

It was developed aiming Linux OS, using the C language thread library, and being a multithreaded programming solution it implements the following multithreaded programming topics:
* Concurrent access to the same memory position and data;
* Thread synchronization;
* Usage of locks and semaphores to achieve the referred synchronization;

The program also has:
* A configuration file was also used as execution argument, so that the simulation is as customizable as possible;
* A log file was used to record each and every simulation step;
* Obvious required data structures and pointer usage;

The implemented solution is based on a client-server architecture, and consequently it also implements Inter-process communication (IPC) using a UNIX socket.

<b>Note:</b> In the code folder you can also find a Readme file with a summarized description of the program functionality and how to run it.
